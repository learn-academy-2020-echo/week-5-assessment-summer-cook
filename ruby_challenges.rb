# ASSESSMENT 5: Ruby Coding Practical Questions

# --------------------1) Create a class called Bike that is initialized with a model, wheels, and a frame size. The default number of wheels is 2. Create a get_info method that returns a sentence with all the data about each bike object.





# Expected output example: 'The Trek bike has 2 wheels and a 168cm frame.'


# -------------------2) Add a bell to the bike class and create the ability to ring the bell when the method is called.





# Expected output example: my_bike.ring_bell => 'Ding ding!'


# -------------------3) Add a speedometer to the Bike class. The speed should be initialized at 0.





# Expected output example: my_bike.speed => 0


# -------------------4) Add the ability to pedal faster. The pedal_faster method should increase the speed by a particular amount.





# Expected output example: my_bike.pedal_faster 10 => 10


# -------------------5) Add the ability to brake. The brake method should decrease the speed by a particular amount. The bike cannot go negative speeds.





# Expected output example: my_bike.brake 15 => 0
